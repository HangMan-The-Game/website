    "about1": "Five <strong>IT</strong> students <i class='bi bi-people'></i>",
    "about2": "Hello everyone! We are a group of <a href='#team' v-scroll-to>five students</a> from <a href='https://www.rapisardidavinci.edu.it/'>ITET Rapisardi - Da Vinci</a> who are about to enter our senior year of high school. And what better way to end our schooling than to do an amazing project together?",
    "about3": "Our <strong>innovative</strong> idea concerns the 'puppet' in the game of hangman. We introduced an interesting variation: instead of falling, the 'puppet' is already there, but every time you make a mistake, a piece of it is removed! This makes the game even more <strong>engaging</strong> and <strong>fun</strong>.",
    "about4": "In <strong>addition</strong>, we have included a <strong>touch display</strong> in our project. The display is mainly used for menu management, allowing intuitive and easy-to-use interaction. As for the input of letters, we have a <strong>dedicated keyboard</strong> that makes the input of choices <strong>quick</strong> and <strong>easy</strong>.",
    "gamedesc1": "The <strong>remodernized</strong> HangMan game is an <strong>innovative</strong> reinterpretation of the classic HangMan game. In this version, pieces fall progressively throughout the game instead of appearing after each mistake is made, providing a unique and engaging visual element. The game features various components that contribute to an <strong>interactive</strong> experience. It is equipped with a microcontroller that manages and controls the game functions. In addition, there is a touch display that allows users to interact <strong>intuitively</strong> with the game. The game keyboard was specially created by us and offers a unique and <strong>engaging</strong> way to enter letters and guess words. The body of the game was made with the use of <strong>electromagnets</strong>, which contribute to the visual effect of <strong>falling</strong> during the game, creating a <strong>dynamic</strong> and engaging <strong>atmosphere</strong>.",
    "gamedesc2": "In addition, the game offers the ability to adjust the <strong>difficulty</strong> to suit the player's preferences. You can select from several difficulty options to <strong>customize</strong> the game experience. All words used in the game are stored in an online <strong>database</strong>, which offers a wide range of words in different categories. This provides a <strong>variety</strong> of challenges for players and allows them to explore a wide selection of words. In addition, a mode is available that allows players to guess the <strong>entire </strong>word by entering it directly, rather than attempting it letter by letter. This option offers a quick alternative for those who already have a conclusion in mind or wish to test their ability to find the correct word. Finally, the base of the game has been <strong>3D printed</strong> by us, allowing for complete customization of the shape and design to perfectly fit the remodeled HangMan game."
