            The <strong>remodernized</strong> HangMan game is an <strong>innovative</strong> reinterpretation of the
            classic HangMan game.
            In this version,
            pieces fall progressively throughout the game instead of appearing after each mistake is made, providing a
            unique and engaging visual element.
            The game features various components that contribute to an <strong>interactive</strong> experience. It is
            equipped with a
            microcontroller that manages and controls the game functions. In addition, there is a touch display that
            allows users to interact <strong>intuitively</strong> with the game.
            The game keyboard was specially created by us and offers a unique and <strong>engaging</strong> way to enter
            letters and guess
            words.
            The body of the game was made with the use of <strong>electromagnets</strong>, which contribute to the visual
            effect of <strong>falling</strong> during the game, creating a <strong>dynamic</strong> and engaging
            <strong>atmosphere</strong>.

            In addition, the game offers the ability to adjust the <strong>difficulty</strong> to suit the player's
            preferences. You can
            select from several difficulty options to <strong>customize</strong> the game experience.

            All words used in the game are stored in an online <strong>database</strong>, which offers a wide range of
            words in different
            categories. This provides a <strong>variety</strong> of challenges for players and allows them to explore a
            wide selection of
            words.

            In addition, a mode is available that allows players to guess the <strong>entire </strong>word by entering it
            directly, rather
            than attempting it letter by letter. This option offers a quick alternative for those who already have a
            conclusion in mind or wish to test their ability to find the correct word.

            Finally, the base of the game has been <strong>3D printed</strong> by us, allowing for complete customization
            of the shape and
            design to perfectly fit the remodeled HangMan game.
